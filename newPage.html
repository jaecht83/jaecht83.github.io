			<h3>Cars</h3>
			<p>My favorite cars are the Ford Crown Victoria, the Mercedes Benz 560SEL and the GMC Typhoon. I have loved automotive engineering since I was 5, and considered engineering school at one point.</p>

			<p>The Crown Victoria was built on the same platform for 32 years (1979-2011). It is still in use worldwide as a police and emergency vehicle, as well as a taxi.</p>

			<p>The S-Class (W126) platform, like the Crown Vic, lasted a long time (1979-1991), and was in service as a limo, taxi, and luxury vehicle worldwide. It was one of the most desired cars for a decade by Hollywood types.</p>

		<div class="typhoon">

			<p>The GMC Typhoon was a turbocharged version of the GMC Jimmy sport-utility vehicle (SUV), and used a 4.3-liter V6. It used the same turbo technology from the 1984-1987 Buick Grand National/T-Type, but on a larger engine and on a truck chassis.</p>

			<h3>XC and Marathon Races</h3>
			<p>My favorite races are the Columbus Marathon, the Cleveland Marathon and the Cincinnati Flying Pig Marathon. I started running in 1998 and have run on and off for the past 20 years. Still a long way to go, and my goal is to qualify for Boston by the time I am 40.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Ran the Columbus Half both times, in 2017 and in 2018. 2017 netted me a time of 1:45:46, which wasn't bad, but it was 68'F and 93% humidity that day. I eventually will run the full version. </p>

			<p>I have not run the CLE Marathon, technically, but know others who have, and have run on part of the race course.</p>

		<div class="cin">

			<p>I have not run on Flying Pig yet, but plan on doing so this spring. It looks challenging! </p>
